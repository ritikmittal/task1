# task1
 
to setup the project, 1st run sutup.sh and then create users. After that you can run setup2.sh to unlock other commands.
for path please give complete path where setup files are present. i.e. " /home/kali/Downloads/task1/task1 "
Here I have added 1 other option that you can give Schedule to members by running ./scripts/Schedule with a date in format
yyyy-mm-dd as a argument in order to provide Schedule for a perticular date.
similarly you can take attendance by ./scripts/Schedule yyyy-mm-dd 
But first assign Schedule before taking attendance
